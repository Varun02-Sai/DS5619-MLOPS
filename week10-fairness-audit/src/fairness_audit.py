"""
Class-based performance disparity audit for the vehicle detector — this
week's lecture content ("Per-Group Fairness Metrics Must Be Monitored
Continuously") applied concretely.

A NOTE ON FRAMING: real fairness audits (Fairlearn, demographic parity,
equalized odds) measure disparity across PROTECTED DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.
BMD-45 is a vehicle-detection dataset with no demographic attributes, so
this lab applies the same underlying methodology — measure a quality metric
independently per group, then flag groups that fall below the rest — to
vehicle CLASSES instead. The statistics and the code are identical to a
real fairness audit; only the grouping variable differs. Don't walk away
thinking "vehicle class" and "protected group" are the same thing — the
audit technique generalizes, the ethical stakes of what you're auditing do
not.

The metric here is per-class RECALL: of all the ground-truth vehicles of a
given class, what fraction did the detector find at all (regardless of
what class label it guessed)? Small-vehicle classes (bicycles,
two-wheelers) are the ones a real detector — and this mock one — tend to
miss more; that's the disparity this audit should surface.

In the lecture's terms, per-class recall is the equal-opportunity check
(true-positive rate per group), not demographic parity (selection rate per
group). Each class has only ~5-30 ground-truth boxes, so a small recall gap
can be sampling noise; other mid-sized classes may also fall below the
threshold for some student IDs.

Fill in the four functions marked # TODO. (adversarial.py adds three more
for the robustness half of this lab.)
